Dependent dropdowns in JQuery and Bootstrap

## Changelog
* 12/11/2015: first version. 3 dropdowns: category dropdown determines what is displayed in the subcategory dropdown. A normal dropdown added to check the code does not hinder it.


## ToDo
* code refactoring, variables, etc.
* disable subcategory dropdown until category dropdown is not chosen
* when changing category dropdown, reset (showing also the down arrow icon) the subcategory dropdown
* various enhancements
* add fiddle to show code behaviour
